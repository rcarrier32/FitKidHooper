/**
 * Fails when eslint findings rise above the recorded budget.
 *
 * CI ran verify:imports, settings-merge, schema, build and smoke — but never
 * eslint. So rules that catch real defects were only ever seen by whoever
 * happened to run lint locally. react-hooks/static-components, for one,
 * is what surfaced the report view rebuilding its whole subtree on every
 * render; nothing in the pipeline would have.
 *
 * A hard zero would mean either suppressing 42 findings that are genuine
 * design questions, or blocking every deploy. A budget lets the number fall
 * over time and blocks it rising. Lower BUDGET whenever you clear some.
