/**
 * Coach / partner brand marks, keyed by the `brandLogo` id a program sets in the catalog.
 *
 * The assets live here rather than in trainingCatalog.js on purpose: that catalog is
 * imported under plain Node by scripts/audit-exercise-skills.mjs, and Node cannot parse a
 * PNG import. Keeping the catalog to a plain string id leaves it runtime-agnostic.
 *
 * Two presentation styles, because partners hand over two kinds of artwork:
 *
 *   free  — white-on-transparent line art. Sits directly on the card with no container.
 *           FKH's theme guardrails clamp `bg`/`surface` to 2–35% lightness so a white mark
 *           is always legible, but the hue is the athlete's choice, which is why these are
 *           keyed transparent rather than shipped on their own background.
 *   boxed — full-colour artwork that carries its own background (gradients, chrome, texture).
 *           It can't be keyed out without destroying the art, so it renders inside a rounded
 *           tile, the way an app icon does. Reads as deliberate instead of like a stray
 *           rectangle sitting on the card.
 *
 * Adding a partner: drop the asset in assets/brands/, add an entry here, and set
 * `brandLogo` on the program. Nothing else needs to change.
