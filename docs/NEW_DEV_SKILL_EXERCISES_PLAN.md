# Plan — Add 33 Player-Development Skills as FKH Exercises

**Status:** Part B (Defense) BUILT ✅ as its own category (B1). Part A (29 exercises) still pending.
**Source:** the dev-skill knowledge layer (`src/lib/skillGraph.js`) + curated videos (`src/lib/skillVideos.js`).
**Audience:** ages 9–14. **Constraint:** do not change FKH UI without approval.

These 33 skills have a reviewed video in `skillVideos.js` but **no matching exercise** in the app today.
This plan turns them into real, athlete-facing exercises.

---

## How an exercise is registered (so we do it right)

An FKH exercise is data in three places in `src/FitKidHooperApp.jsx` (+ one label file):

1. **`W_<CATEGORY>` array** — the exercise object:
   ```js
   { id:"gh-in-out", name:"In-and-Out Dribble", tag:"Rhythm Move", difficulty:"beginner",
     ageRange:[9,14], funScore:8, estimatedDuration:90,
     desc:"…one-sentence what/why…",
     cues:["cue 1","cue 2","cue 3"],
     trainer:"Get Handles Basketball", videoId:"dF61fgRPa3g",
     videoTitle:"How To In & Out Dribble — Get Handles" },
   ```
2. **`EXERCISE_META[id]`** — powers age-aware generation (REQUIRED, or the generator mis-handles it):
   ```js
   "gh-in-out": { difficulty:"beginner", impactLevel:"low", intensityLevel:"medium",
     movementType:"skill", bodyFocus:["hands","coordination"],
     basketballTransfer:["ball handling","change of pace"], equipment:"ball",
     spaceRequired:"small", ageRange:[9,14], estimatedDuration:90, funScore:8, workoutRole:["main"] },
   ```
3. **`WORKOUTS`** map already contains the category key (e.g. `game_handles: W_GAME_HANDLES`) — no change needed for existing categories.
4. **`CATS`** in `src/lib/categories.js` — label + emoji (only for a NEW category).

**→ Adding to an EXISTING category = pure data (steps 1–2). No UI change.**
**→ A NEW category = steps 1–4 + `SCHEDULE`/`SCHED_TO_TEMPLATE` wiring (multi-file). Needs sign-off.**

## Part A — 29 exercises into EXISTING categories (DATA ONLY, no UI change)

Target category shown per group. Each needs a `W_` object + `EXERCISE_META` entry. Videos are the
current first-sweep picks; ★ = will be re-checked by the youth re-enrichment (see Part C) before final.

## Part B — 4 DEFENSE exercises (needs a category decision)

Defense has **no `W_` category today** (defensive slide currently lives in `W_SPEED` as `def-slide`).
The 4 skills: **Lateral Slide, Containment / Mirror, Shot Contest (no foul), Recover / X-Out.**

Two options:

- **B1 — New `W_DEFENSE` category (recommended).** Defense is a real skill area; it deserves its own
  card. Touches: new `W_DEFENSE` array + `EXERCISE_META` (data) · `CATS.defense = {label:"Defense", emoji:"🛡️"}`
  in categories.js · `WORKOUTS.defense = W_DEFENSE` · one `SCHEDULE` day + `SCHED_TO_TEMPLATE.defense`
  · add to the category picker list (~line 2185) and a session template (~line 1912). Multi-file registry
  wiring, no new UI *components* — the existing category screens render it. **This is the "provide a plan"
  UI change — approve before I touch it.**
- **B2 — Fold into `basketball_iq` or `athletic`.** Zero new category; defense skills ride an existing
  card. Less discoverable, but no category wiring. Fastest.

**Recommendation: B1** — a Defense card matches the skillGraph areas and gives the 5 defensive dev-skills
(these 4 + the 3 rebounding micro-cues later) a real home.

**DONE (B1 built):** `W_DEFENSE` = 4 new on-ball exercises (`def-lateral`, `def-contain`, `def-contest`,
`def-recover`) with youth-appropriate videos (Jr. NBA ×2, Brian McCormick, Basketball Coach Allen).
`WORKOUTS.defense` cross-lists 18 existing defense-transfer agility drills by reference (no dup).
Full registry wired: `CATS.defense`+dot, `WORKOUT_TEMPLATES.defense`, `SCHED_TO_TEMPLATE.defense`,
gap-check + report pickers. Verified: builds clean, all ids resolve, no console errors.

## Part C — Youth re-enrichment (in flight)

`enrich-dev-skills.mjs --youth` (already built) biases to age-9–14 channels (Jr. NBA, Cramer,
Get Handles) and beginner queries. Full 33-skill youth run is ~3.3k YouTube quota units; today's
budget was mostly spent on the first sweep, so run it after the daily quota reset:

```
cd nextplay && node scripts/enrich-dev-skills.mjs --youth --ids <33 ids> --top 3
# → scripts/dev-enrichment-review-youth.json → re-curate → swap ★ videos before finalizing
```

Skills marked ★ above have non-youth or ultra-short current picks and should be youth-refined first.

---

## Recommended sequence

1. **Approve Part B option** (B1 new Defense category vs B2 fold-in).
2. Run **Part C** youth re-enrichment (quota reset) → finalize videos.
3. Land **Part A** (29 exercises) as data — batchable by category, no UI change.
4. Land **Part B** per the approved option.
5. Sanity pass: every new `id` has both a `W_` object and an `EXERCISE_META` entry.
